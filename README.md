This Food Ordering App is a single-page application (SPA) built with React using modern web development practices. The app offers a seamless user experience for browsing restaurant menus, searching for specific food items, and managing a shopping cart. 
The application leverages Redux for state management, React Router for client-side routing, and uses Tailwind CSS for styling.
